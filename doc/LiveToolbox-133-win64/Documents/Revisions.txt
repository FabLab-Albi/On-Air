* New tidbit commands:
  XFade: cross fade channels over a period of time.

		  fades up ch 1-3 to -6db and down ch 4-5 to -90db over 8 sec)

* Enhanced tidbit commands:
  Store:  now can store a range of responses (eg Store 1 /ch/01/mix/##/level 1-6)
  Recall: now can function as a paste over a range (eg. Recall 1 /ch/##/ 3-6)
          This above example would copy/paste monitor mixes 1-6 from ch 01 to 03-06
		  Recall also has a * wildcard that substitutes any character from the Store to the Recall
		  (eg. from above Recall /ch/##*** 3-6 would be equivalent to /ch/##/mix)

	eg.	Fade dca 3-6 7 2	Fade DCA 3-6 over 7 seconds to +2 db (this may result in an increase)
* New tidbit command - Buffer: Provides buffer (delay) in milliseconds for fade timing purposes
	Buffer #	eg. Buffer 5	Add 5ms between fade steps
* Fade types include: ch, auxin, fxret, bus, lr, mono, mtx, dca

-----------------------
Ver: 1.06.0
Date: December 6, 2015

Bug Fixes
* If percentage (,p) or db (,d) type does not get a response from the OSC server,
  it assumes the current value is 0. Changed to: if no response, do nothing.
  **Note** There is still a bug with these types when used in multiple line tidbits.
* If tidbit title was long and the popup font was large, it did not scale the width
  of the button correctly - fixed.
* Cmd Editor find now finds partial commands
* /meters did not expect a response - fixed.

  Major rewrite of the OscTxRx engine to make this happen.
  Receive event must now be included in the app, not the OscTxRx unit.


Enhancements, New Features
* Toggle type can now toggle through multi-value enumerated values
  eg. to toggle through color values,
      use "/ch/01/config/color ,t 6 15" (toggle through values 6 to 15)
* New linear (db) type - ,l <lin-value> <minvalue> <maxvalue>
* New tidbit commands:
  Store:  stores a current value from X32 into memory.
          Many values can be added to a store (0..5).
		  eg. Store 2 /ch/12/config/color  - stores ch 12 color value in store 2
		      Store 2  - clears all values in store 2
  Recall: recalls what has been stored and sends to X32
          eg. Recall 3  - recalls all values in store 3 and sends them to X32
  Launch: launches a cue, scene, snippet or tidbit (file)
          eg. Launch scene 15   - launches scene #15 (located in X32)
		      Launch snippet 7  - launches snippet #7 (located in X32)
		      Launch tidbit "C:\Paul\tidbits\Mute Ch 1-16"  - launches the tidbit file
